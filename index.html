        To make a Minecraft SMP (Survival Multiplayer) server, follow these steps:
        <br><br>
        1. Choose a Hosting Method: Decide whether you want to host the server on your own computer or use a third-party hosting service.
        <br><br>
        2. Download the Minecraft Server Software: Go to <a href="https://mcutils.com/server-jars" target="_blank">server.jar</a> and download the server software for the version of Minecraft you want to play. and download the <a href="https://mcutils.com/start-file-generator" target="_blank">start file generator</a> to create a start file for your server.
        <br><br>
        3. Set Up the Server: Create a new folder for your server files, place the downloaded server software in that folder, and run it to generate the necessary configuration files.
        <br><br>
        4. Configure Server Settings: Open the server.properties file and customize settings such as game mode, difficulty, maximum players, and more.
        <br><br>
        5. Port Forwarding: If you're hosting the server on your own computer, you'll need to set up port forwarding on your router to allow other players to connect. The default port for Minecraft is 25565. OR Download <a href="https://playit.gg/download/plugins" target="_blank">Playit.gg</a> or <a href="https://connect.minekube.com/guide/connectors/plugin.html#downloading-the-connect-plugin" target="_blank">minekube</a> plugin and setup like that.
        <br><br>
        6. Share Your IP Address: Provide your public IP address (and port number if necessary) to friends who want to join your SMP server.
        <br><br>
        7. Start the Server: Run the server software again to start your SMP server. Players can now connect using your IP address OR the playit.gg IP and/or the minekube IP.
        <br><br>
        8. Manage Your Server: Use server commands and plugins (if applicable) to manage gameplay, moderate players, and enhance the experience.
        <br><br>
        Enjoy playing on your Minecraft SMP server with friends!
        <br><br>
        NOTE: The Plugins for playit.gg and minekube only work with Java Edition of Minecraft. And DO NOT Suppport Fabric, Quilt, or any other modloaders!!!!
        <br><br>
        For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting, refer to online guides and communities dedicated to Minecraft server hosting.
        <br><br>
        And For The 3rd Party Hosting Services, I Recommend And Are Free: <a href="https://elementiamc.xyz/" target="_blank">ElementiaMC</a> and <a href="https://minefort.com/" target="_blank">Minefort</a>
        <br><br>
        NOTE: ElementiaMC needs DISCORD to use! And Neither of them are 24/7 servers unless you pay and/or active player base!
        <br><br>
        Enjoy your Minecraft SMP adventure!
